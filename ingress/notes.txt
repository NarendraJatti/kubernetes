Ingress is just a configuration file. It doesnâ€™t do anything on its own.

It relies on an Ingress Controller to implement the rules.

Popular Ingress Controllers:

NGINX Ingress Controller: The most widely used Ingress Controller.

Traefik: A modern, cloud-native Ingress Controller.

HAProxy: Known for high performance.

Istio Ingress Gateway: Part of the Istio service mesh, offering advanced traffic management and security features.
