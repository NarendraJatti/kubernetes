imp>>if we change value in configamp ,container value will NOT updated,we need 
to recreate the pod to get new values from configamp>>for this use volumemounts-use the environments
as files
In the case of using volumes and volumeMounts for injecting a ConfigMap into a Pod, the Pod can dynamically receive updated values from the ConfigMap without needing to be recreated. However, note that the container itself will not automatically reload the values unless it is programmed to watch the file system for changes or the Pod is restarted.

========
In your Node.js app, you use a library like prom-client to expose metrics. For example, you define a /metrics route in your Node.js app that exposes custom metrics (like HTTP request duration, memory usage, etc.).

Create a Node.js application with Prometheus metrics.
Create a Kubernetes ConfigMap to inject the Node.js app (server.js).
Create a Kubernetes Pod that runs the Node.js app.
Install Prometheus in your Kubernetes cluster.
Configure Prometheus to scrape the Node.js app for metrics.
Verify the setup and visualize the data.

If you are actively modifying the monitoring logic in server.js (for example, adding new metrics or changing how metrics are collected), injecting the file via a ConfigMap allows you to update the code without rebuilding the entire Docker image.
This reduces development iteration time and allows you to apply changes quickly.



Yes, the Kubernetes API server does expose certain metrics, and Prometheus can scrape these metrics to monitor the Kubernetes control plane and other components.
How Prometheus Scrapes API Server Metrics:
When using the Prometheus stack in Kubernetes (like the kube-prometheus-stack Helm chart), the setup typically includes a ServiceMonitor resource that instructs Prometheus to scrape metrics from the API server.
For Prometheus to scrape the API server metrics, it needs appropriate permissions. When deploying Prometheus via Helm or the Prometheus Operator, the necessary Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) roles are usually created automatically. These roles allow Prometheus to:

Read from the API server's /metrics endpoint
Access specific metrics from various components of the cluster

 Summary:
The Kubernetes API server does expose metrics via the /metrics endpoint.
Prometheus can scrape the API server’s metrics by using a ServiceMonitor or direct service discovery.
This scraping process is often automatically configured if you’re using Prometheus Operator or kube-prometheus-stack.
Prometheus can also scrape other Kubernetes control plane components like etcd, controller-manager, and scheduler.
we need to setup servicemonitor manually to expose argocd metrics.

To configure Prometheus scraping for an NGINX pod using the annotations provided in your example, you need to follow a few steps. These steps include:

Deploying the NGINX pod with Prometheus scrape annotations
Configuring Prometheus to scrape the metrics from the pod
Exposing the metrics from NGINX (either using an exporter or custom configuration)
Step 1: Deploy NGINX Pod with Prometheus Scrape Annotations
The annotations you've provided will instruct Prometheus to scrape metrics from the pod. Here's how the pod manifest looks:

yaml
Copy
Edit
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
  labels:
    app: nginx
  annotations:
    prometheus.io/scrape: "true"              # Enable scraping for this pod
    prometheus.io/port: "8080"                # Scrape from this port
    prometheus.io/path: "/metrics"            # Scrape from this path
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 8080                     # NGINX will serve on port 8080
This pod is an NGINX container running on port 8080 with the annotations that tell Prometheus to scrape metrics from /metrics on that port.

Step 2: Expose Metrics from NGINX
By default, NGINX does not expose Prometheus-compatible metrics. You can use NGINX Prometheus Exporter to expose these metrics.

a. Install NGINX Prometheus Exporter
The NGINX Prometheus Exporter is a sidecar container that will gather NGINX metrics and expose them in a Prometheus-compatible format.

Update your pod manifest to include the exporter:

yaml
Copy
Edit
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
  labels:
    app: nginx
  annotations:
    prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
    prometheus.io/port: "9113"                # The exporter exposes metrics on this port
    prometheus.io/path: "/metrics"
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 8080

  - name: nginx-prometheus-exporter
    image: nginx/nginx-prometheus-exporter:0.10.0
    args:
    - -nginx.scrape-uri=http://localhost:8080/stub_status
    ports:
    - containerPort: 9113                     # The exporter exposes metrics on port 9113
Here’s how it works:

The NGINX Prometheus Exporter container runs alongside the NGINX container and scrapes metrics from the NGINX status endpoint (http://localhost:8080/stub_status).
The exporter exposes these metrics on port 9113, which Prometheus will scrape.
Note: You need to enable the NGINX stub_status module, which exposes the status of NGINX (active connections, requests per second, etc.).

To enable it, modify your NGINX configuration to include something like this:

nginx
Copy
Edit
server {
    listen 8080;
    location /stub_status {
        stub_status on;
        access_log off;
    }
}
Step 3: Configure Prometheus to Scrape the Pod
Now that you’ve deployed the NGINX pod with Prometheus scraping enabled, you need to configure Prometheus to scrape this pod's metrics.

In your Prometheus configuration file (prometheus.yml), add a scrape job that matches the labels of the pod:

yaml
Copy
Edit
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'nginx-pod'
    kubernetes_sd_configs:
      - role: pod
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_app]
        action: keep
        regex: nginx
Explanation:

kubernetes_sd_configs enables service discovery for pods in Kubernetes.
The relabel_configs ensures that only the pods with the label app: nginx are scraped.
Prometheus automatically scrapes pods that match the job criteria, and since your pod has the annotations for scraping, Prometheus will scrape metrics from the NGINX Prometheus exporter running on port 9113 and path /metrics.
Step 4: Verify Scraping in Prometheus
Once you deploy the pod and configure Prometheus, access the Prometheus UI (typically at http://<prometheus-ip>:9090).
In the Prometheus UI, go to Status -> Targets, and verify that your NGINX pod is listed as one of the scrape targets.
If everything is set up correctly, Prometheus will start collecting metrics from the /metrics endpoint exposed by the NGINX Prometheus Exporter.
Example of Metrics Exposed
The metrics exposed by the exporter will include various NGINX-related data points, like:

nginx_http_requests_total: Total number of HTTP requests.
nginx_http_connections_active: Number of active connections.
nginx_http_connections_accepted: Total number of accepted connections.
You can now create Prometheus queries or Grafana dashboards to monitor your NGINX metrics.

Summary
Deploy NGINX pod with annotations to enable Prometheus scraping.
Add NGINX Prometheus Exporter as a sidecar container to expose NGINX metrics.
Update Prometheus configuration to scrape the NGINX pod's metrics.
Verify in Prometheus that scraping is working.
This setup gives you real-time monitoring of your NGINX pods using Prometheus.

for above do we need to install promethesu separately??and how to get <prometheus-ip>?

Yes, to scrape metrics from the NGINX pod as described above, you need to install Prometheus in your Kubernetes cluster separately. Prometheus is not installed by default in Kubernetes.

Here’s how you can install Prometheus in your cluster and obtain the Prometheus IP for accessing the UI:

1. Install Prometheus using Helm
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, and it's the easiest way to install Prometheus.

a. Install Helm (if not already installed)
If Helm is not installed on your system, install it using the following commands:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
b. Add Prometheus Helm chart repository
bash
Copy
Edit
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
c. Install Prometheus in the Kubernetes cluster
Use the following Helm command to install Prometheus:

bash
Copy
Edit
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus
This will deploy Prometheus in your Kubernetes cluster. By default, it creates a service called prometheus-server to expose the Prometheus web interface.

2. Get the Prometheus IP Address
Once Prometheus is installed, you can access the Prometheus UI by getting the external IP or port of the Prometheus service.

a. Check Prometheus service
To get the Prometheus service details, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl get svc -l app=prometheus
This will show you the services related to Prometheus. Look for the prometheus-server service:

bash
Copy
Edit
NAME                     TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)
prometheus-server        ClusterIP      10.100.200.54   <prometheus-ip> 9090/TCP
If the service type is ClusterIP, Prometheus is only accessible within the cluster.
If the service type is LoadBalancer or NodePort, you'll have an external IP or port.
b. Access Prometheus UI
If you installed Prometheus with a ClusterIP (the default type), and you want to access it locally, you can use port-forwarding to expose Prometheus:

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-server 9090:9090
Then, open Prometheus in your browser at:

arduino
we need to create servicemonitor object to expose argocd metrics to Prometheus as below
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: argocd-metrics
  namespace: argocd
  labels:
    release: kode-kloud-prometheus-stack
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: argocd-metrics
  endpoints:
  - port: metrics

apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: argocd-applicationset-controller-metrics
  namespace: argocd
  labels:
    release: kode-kloud-prometheus-stack
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: argocd-applicationset-controller
  endpoints:
  - port: metrics

Copy
Edit
http://localhost:9090
c. If Prometheus is exposed via LoadBalancer
If Prometheus is exposed as a LoadBalancer service (you can change this in the Helm values), the EXTERNAL-IP field will show the public IP address. Use that IP to access the Prometheus UI:

arduino
Copy
Edit
http://<prometheus-ip>:9090
3. Verify Prometheus Installation
Once Prometheus is up, you can:

Visit the Prometheus UI at http://localhost:9090 (or <prometheus-ip>:9090 if using LoadBalancer).
Go to Status > Targets in the UI to see the list of all targets (pods/services) that Prometheus is scraping.
Summary of Steps:
Install Prometheus using Helm.
Get Prometheus service details using kubectl get svc.
If the service is ClusterIP, use port forwarding to access Prometheus locally on http://localhost:9090.
If the service is LoadBalancer, use the external IP address to access Prometheus.
Now Prometheus is set up and scraping metrics from the NGINX pod (or any other pod) as per the configuration in your Kubernetes manifest files.

PodMonitor for Applications Without a Service:
If your application Pods don't expose a Service but you still want to monitor them, you can use a PodMonitor to directly scrape the Pods.


When you configure Prometheus via the Helm stack on your Kubernetes cluster (like EKS), Prometheus does not use the control plane's EBS volumes or storage to store metrics by default. Instead, it uses storage options that you specify in the Helm chart configuration.

Here’s how it works:

1. Prometheus Storage in Kubernetes:
Persistent Storage for Metrics: To store metrics persistently, Prometheus needs Persistent Volumes (PVs). When you install the Prometheus Helm chart (kube-prometheus-stack), you have the option to configure persistent storage, and Prometheus will store its metrics there.
Prometheus does not use the control plane storage or EBS volumes allocated to the control plane. It requires a separate Persistent Volume in your data plane (worker nodes) to persist metrics.
These metrics are persistent if you configure persistent storage (e.g., an EBS volume) for Prometheus.
2. Helm Chart Configuration for Persistent Storage:
When deploying the Prometheus stack via Helm, you can configure persistent storage by setting up a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) in the Helm chart values. Here’s how you can enable persistent storage:

Storage Class: Specify the storage class to use, such as an EBS-backed storage class in EKS.
Size: Define the amount of storage for Prometheus to use (e.g., 50Gi or 100Gi).
Retention: Set a retention policy for metrics (e.g., keep metrics for 15 days).
3. Example Configuration for Persistent Storage:
In the Helm values (values.yaml) for prometheus (part of kube-prometheus-stack), you can configure it like this:

yaml
Copy
Edit
prometheus:
  prometheusSpec:
    storageSpec:
      volumeClaimTemplate:
        spec:
          storageClassName: gp2
          accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 50Gi
In this example:

storageClassName: Defines the EBS-backed storage class (e.g., gp2 in AWS).
storage: 50Gi: Defines a 50Gi Persistent Volume for Prometheus to store its metrics.
ReadWriteOnce: The access mode for the PVC.
Once configured, Prometheus will persist its data (metrics) in this volume, ensuring that data survives across pod restarts or upgrades.

4. Retention of Metrics:
Prometheus also allows you to configure how long you want to retain metrics data. This is important because the longer the retention period, the more storage you need.

To configure the retention period, you can set the following in your Helm values file:

yaml
Copy
Edit
prometheus:
  prometheusSpec:
    retention: 15d  # Retain metrics for 15 days
Retention period: This example keeps metrics for 15 days.
After the retention period, older metrics are automatically deleted, freeing up space.
5. Where the Storage Happens (Worker Nodes, Not Control Plane):
When you configure storage for Prometheus, it uses the EBS volumes (or other storage options) attached to your Kubernetes worker nodes (data plane) rather than the control plane.
The control plane (API server, etcd, etc.) is managed by AWS and does not handle Prometheus's metric storage.
The Persistent Volume that Prometheus uses will be scheduled on your EKS worker nodes, not the control plane.
6. What Happens If You Don’t Configure Persistent Storage:
If you do not configure persistent storage for Prometheus, the metrics will be stored ephemerally in the pod’s filesystem.
In such a case, if the Prometheus pod restarts or is rescheduled, all the stored metrics will be lost because there is no persistence.
7. Log Storage:
Prometheus does not store logs directly. It stores metrics. Logs (if relevant) are usually stored by other systems like Loki, Fluentd, or Elasticsearch.
For logging, you would need to configure a separate logging stack (e.g., Loki for Prometheus or a centralized logging solution like Fluentd).
8. Recap:
Prometheus uses Persistent Volumes (e.g., backed by EBS in AWS) to store metrics, not the control plane storage.
You need to configure persistent storage in the Helm chart (values.yaml) to ensure metrics are stored persistently.
By default, Prometheus stores its metrics on the worker nodes (data plane) via a Persistent Volum
